# Dinosaurs and Deno: A Beginner's Guide to the Jurassic Web

Hello there, future web developers! As a senior developer who's seen it all, I'm here to guide you on an exciting journey to the wild world of Deno. Are you ready to dive into the Jurassic age of web development? Great! Let's get started!

Once upon a time in the land of JavaScript, there was a dinosaur named Node.js. It ruled the server-side kingdom for years. However, as time went on, it began to show its age, and some issues became apparent. Enter the era of Deno, a younger, more agile dinosaur ready to take on the web's ever-changing landscape. It's time to learn how to tame this new beast and make it work for you!

What is Deno, you ask? Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, built on the same V8 engine that powers Google Chrome. Just imagine it as a super-powered T-Rex with the brains of Albert Einstein and the speed of Usain Bolt!

Here's why Deno is roaring its way to the top:

1. **Secure by default**: With Deno, you no longer have to worry about rogue scripts stealing your cookies or hijacking your precious data. Deno is like a protective Triceratops that won't let any code run without your permission. It's the bodyguard your code always needed.

2. **Built-in TypeScript support**: TypeScript is like the Spinosaurus of the programming world – versatile, powerful, and loved by many. With Deno, you don't need to go through the hassle of setting up a separate compiler; it's all included right out of the box!

3. **Single executable**: Deno comes as a single executable file, making it easier to install and manage. It's like a Pterodactyl that swoops in and simplifies your life, no more digging through layers of confusing dependencies!

4. **Browser-compatible APIs**: Deno adopts browser-compatible APIs, which means you can use familiar functions like `fetch()` to make HTTP requests. It's like going to a Jurassic park and finding all your favorite dinosaurs there – the fun never stops!

5. **Third-party modules**: Deno uses URLs to import third-party modules, making it easy to manage dependencies without a package manager. It's like having a helpful Brachiosaurus fetch the best leaves from the tallest trees for you!

Now, you might be thinking, "This all sounds great, but how do I start?" Well, fear not, young developer! Here are the basic steps to set up Deno:

1. **Install Deno**: To invite this friendly dinosaur to your computer, visit the Deno website ([https://deno.land/](https://deno.land/)) and follow the instructions for your operating system. It's like opening the gates to your very own Jurassic Park!

2. **Create your first Deno script**: Unleash your creativity and write your first Deno script. Save it as "helloDeno.ts" and write the following:

   ```typescript
   console.log("Welcome to the world of Deno!");
   ```

3. **Run your script**: Time to see your creation come to life! Open your terminal, navigate to the folder containing "helloDeno.ts," and type:

   ```
   deno run helloDeno.ts
   ```

4. **Watch the magic unfold**: If all goes well, you'll see the message "Welcome to the world of Deno!" appear on your screen. Congratulations, you've just taken your first step into the Jurassic age of web development!

There you have it, future web developers! You're now ready to embark on a thrilling adventure with Deno, the young and powerful dinosaur that's ready to reshape the world of web development. But wait, there's more! Let me share some more tips and tricks to make your Deno experience even more enjoyable.

6. **Learn to manage permissions**: Remember, Deno is like a protective Triceratops that keeps your code secure. To access certain features, such as file system access or network access, you'll need to grant permissions explicitly. For example, if your script needs to read a file, you'll run it like this:

   ```
   deno run --allow-read helloDeno.ts
   ```

   Don't worry, though; Deno will prompt you if it needs any specific permissions. Just make sure to keep your guard up and only grant access when necessary!

7. **Get familiar with Deno's built-in tools**: Deno comes packed with a plethora of built-in tools that make your life easier. For instance, it has a built-in test runner, linter, and formatter. It's like having a team of helpful Velociraptors to assist you with your coding adventures!

   To run tests, use:

   ```
   deno test
   ```

   To lint your code, use:

   ```
   deno lint
   ```

   And to format your code, use:

   ```
   deno fmt
   ```

8. **Explore the Deno Standard Library**: The Deno Standard Library is like a treasure trove of utility functions and modules, ready for you to use. Visit the official repository ([https://deno.land/std](https://deno.land/std)) and see what gems you can uncover!

9. **Join the Deno community**: Just like the dinosaurs, we developers are social creatures. So, why not join the Deno community and learn from fellow developers? Check out the Deno GitHub repository ([https://github.com/denoland/deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)), follow them on Twitter ([@deno_land](https://twitter.com/deno_land)), or join their Discord server ([https://discord.gg/deno](https://discord.gg/deno)) to stay up-to-date and get involved!

10. **Practice, practice, practice!**: The best way to become a Deno expert is by practicing and building projects. After all, practice makes perfect, and even the mighty T-Rex had to learn how to walk before it could run!

There you have it, young developers! You're now equipped with the knowledge and tools to venture into the untamed world of Deno. So, put on your explorer's hat, saddle up your favorite dinosaur, and get ready to conquer the Jurassic age of web development. Happy coding!
