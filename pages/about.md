# **About Me**

Hello, and welcome to my Github page! My name is Tony, and I'm a lead developer with a passion for building cutting-edge applications using AWS technologies, React, Typescript, and Javascript.

With 6 years of experience in the field, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from simple web applications to complex distributed systems. My expertise lies in leveraging AWS services, such as EC2, S3, Lambda, and more, to build scalable, reliable, and high-performance applications that meet the needs of my clients.

While I may not have many public projects on my Github page, I'm constantly working on new projects and improving my skills. I take pride in my ability to work closely with my team and clients to deliver exceptional results, and I'm always looking for ways to innovate and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

If you're looking for a lead developer who can bring your ideas to life and deliver results, look no further. I'm eager to discuss your project and help you achieve your goals. Feel free to reach out to me to learn more about my skills and experience.
